# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1()
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers. - line 4 is defined with a block while line 6 refers to the global variable

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1()) = 10
console.log(y) = error - y is not defined (only available within the function)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x); = 9

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y); y = {x:10}
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
